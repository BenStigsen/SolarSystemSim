# SolarSystemSim
A simulation of our solar system, with focus on the Hohmann transfer orbit and Kepler's laws of planetary motion. Made with p5.js.

_Below are images of the simulation. I've had several friends mention to me that the orbits should be ellipses, which they are. This is not a mistake, every orbit in our solar system have a low eccentricity, or, in Layman's terms, the orbits are almost perfect circles._

_Yes, I know Pluto is a dwarf planet, but I didn't want to leave the little guy out :)_
